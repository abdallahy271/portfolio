          <h2>Front-end Developer</h2>

          <p>I'm an aspiring software engineer. Recently, I began looking into the web development path and took courses on edX, Sololearn and Udemy to gain required skills. As a student, I'm currently searching for a summer internship opportunity, be it remote or even unpaid. I am hoping to  apply newly-acquired knowledge.
            </p>
          <p>My objective is to serve people and find the best solution to world problems. You can learn more about me <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duX85yvjX-Q" alt = "" target= "_blank">here</a></p>
